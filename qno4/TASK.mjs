// Changing Guest List: You just heard that one of your guests can’t make the dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations. 
//You’ll have to think of someone else to invite.

// • Start with your program from Exercise 14. Add a print statement at the end of your program stating the name of the guest who can’t make it.
